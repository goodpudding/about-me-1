    <h1>Welcome to my AboutMe Page</h1>
    <p>
    Hi, my name is Miranda and I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in physical science. Besides college, I also worked as a welder, a helicopter mechanic, and a business administrator. After completing my degree, I realized that neither medical school or the lab life was for me, so I decided to leverage my quantitaive reasoning skills to enter the analytics field, and I believe coding can help me greatly in data analytics.

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy baking, and beer tasting, and container-gardening.
